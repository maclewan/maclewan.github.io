# e-registrant
Simple (or maybe not) registration tool for reconstructed Engler Organ in Wroclaw.

# Why and what?
Main reason why this app was created is that each artist 
playing concert on this instrument tries to re-invent the wheel, sometimes
with tolerable result, sometime not. Graphical user interface is easy to use, 
intuitive (as stops layout is based on real stops layout), and 
allows generating smooth pdf files, without many mistakes.

Main goal is to reduce time spend on re-inventing the wheel, then 
writing down registration on paper 
(spotting mistakes, fixing them, writing down again, and so on),
and to maximise potential time for practicing and getting used to instrument.
