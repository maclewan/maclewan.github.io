# e-registrant
Simple (or maybe not) registration tool for reconstructed Engler Organ in Wroclaw.
<hr>

# Why and what?
Main reason why this app was created is that each artist 
playing concert on this instrument tries to re-invent the wheel, sometimes
with tolerable result, sometime not. Graphical user interface is easy to use, 
intuitive (as stops layout is based on real stops layout), and 
allows generating smooth pdf files, without many mistakes.

Main goal is to reduce time spend on re-inventing the wheel, then 
writing down registration on paper 
(spotting mistakes, fixing them, writing down again, and so on),
and to maximise potential time for practicing and getting used to instrument.

# Tutorial

## Basics
Application can be used on mobile phones, tablets and desktops, running on windows, 
linux, android, macOS, iOS, in (probably) all modern web browsers, but I would recommend **Chrome** on both - 
mobile and desktop devices.

### iOS
Some functionalities (pdf generating) may be not working properly on all iOS devices. 
Workaround is to export presets to `.englerjson` file and open it on
different, not-iOS device.

## Registration
Stops can be marked as attached by clicking on them, what causes `X` to appear in corresponding button.
It refers to stops in main panels, RP panel, ventils and coppels.

### Coppels
Coppels can be found in the middle, between left and right panels.

### Default stops
Some handles are set by default as attached - all ventils, light and motor.

## Presets
As multiple pieces requires multiple registrations, application provides way to create multiple presets (combinations).
New presets can be added with corresponding buttons.

### Renaming
Preset can be renamed by selecting it, and changing name in input, under `Add ...` buttons.

### Removing
Preset can be cleared, or deleted. Both actions triggers warning, before action is fulfilled.

## Sharing configs
Application provides interface to save current presets data, and load it later on any device. 
This feature can be useful f.e. for multiple pieces or parts, or just for backup purposes. This also 
allows moving all data to another platform, when iOS functionalities decide to fail.

All actions can be done in `Menu`, just by expanding it on top.

## Generating PDF
Finally, when all presets are done, you can generate pdf file from them, and later print, or open on another device.
As mentioned above, it's not 100% guaranteed, that this feature will work properly on iOS devices.
